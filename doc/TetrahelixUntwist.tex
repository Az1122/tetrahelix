\begin{abstract}
  The Boerdijk--Coxeter helix (BC helix, or tetrahelix) is a
  face-to-face stack of regular tetrahedra forming a helical column.  Considering the edges of
  these tetrahedra as structural members, the resulting structure is attractive and
  inherently rigid, and therefore interesting to architects,
  mechanical engineers, and robotocists.  A formula is developed that matches the
  visually apparent helices forming the outer rails of the BC helix.
  This formula is generalized to a formula convenient to designers.
  Formulae for 
  computing the
  parameters that give edge-length minimax-optimal tetrahelices
  are given, defining a continuum of tetrahelices of varying curvature.
  The endpoints of the optimality of this continuum are the BC helix and
  a structure of zero curvature, the \emph{equitetrabeam}.
  Numerically finding the rail angle from the equation for
  pitch allows optimal tetrahelices of any pitch to be designed. 
  An interactive tool for such design and experimentation is provided: \url{https://pubinv.github.io/tetrahelix/}.
  A formula for the inradius of optimal tetrahelices is given.

\section{Introduction}

The Boerdijk--Coxeter helix\cite{coxeter1985simplicial} (BC helix), is
a face-to-face stack of tetrahedra that winds about a straight axis.
Because architects, structural engineers, and robotocists are inspired
by and follow such regular mathematical models but can also build structures and
machines of differing or even dynamically changing length, it is
useful to develop the mathematics of structures formed from tetrahedra
where we relax regularity.


The vertices of the tetrahedra lie upon
three helices about the central axis.
The glussbot\cite{readglussbot} (or Tetrobot)\cite{TetrobotBook} uses the regularity of
this geometry to make a tentacle-like robot that can crawl like a slug
or mollusc.  The Tetrobot uses mechanical actuators which can change their length, connected by special joints,
such as the 3D printable Song-Kwon-Kim\cite{song2003spherical} joint, or the CMS joint\cite{HamlinSandersonCMS}
which allow many members to meet in a single point.
Such machines can
follow purely regular mathematical models such as the Boerdijkâ€“-Coxeter
helix or the Octet Truss\cite{richard1961synergetic}.

Buckminster Fuller called the BC helix a \emph{tetrahelix}\cite{fuller1982synergetics},
a term now commonly used. In this paper we reserve \emph{BC helix} to mean the purely regular structre and use \emph{tetrahelix} to refer
to any structure isomorphic to the BC helix.

     \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/VerticalCloseUp.png}
     \caption{BC Helix Close-up (orthogonal)}
  \label{fig:closeup}
\end{figure}



Imagining \cref{fig:closeup} as a static mechanical structure,
we observe that it is useful to the mechanical engineer or
robotocist because the structure remains an inherently rigid,
omni-triangulated space frame, which is
mechanically strong.
Imagine further in \cref{fig:closeup}, that each static edge was replaced with an
actuator that could dynamically become shorter or longer in response to electronic control,
and the vertices were a joint that supported sufficient angular displacement
for this to be possible. An example of such a machine is a glussbot, shown in \cref{fig:glussbot}.

A BC helix does not rest stably on a plane. It is convenient to
be able to ``untwist'' it and to form a tetrahelix space frame that has a
flat planar surface. By making length changes in a certain way, we can
untwist a tetrahelix to form a \emph{tetrabeam} which has planar faces
and has, for example, an equilateral triangular profile. This paper
develops the equations needed to untwist the tetrahelix. All math
developed here is available in JavaScript and demonstrated by an interactive
design website \url{https://pubinv.github.io/tetrahelix/}\cite{readtetrahelix},
from which \cref{fig:closeup} and
the figures below are taken.

     \caption{A Continuum of Tetrahelices}
  \label{fig:series}
\end{figure}


\Cref{fig:series} displays a continuum of tetrahelices optimal in a certain sense, which is the result of this
paper. The closest helix is the BC helix, and the furthest
is the equitetrabeam, defined in \cref{sec:equitetrabeam}.

\section{A Designer's Formulation of the BC Helix}

We would like to design nearly regular tetrahelices with a formula that
gives the vertices in space. Eventually we would like to design nearly regular
tetrahelices by choosing the lengths of a small set of members.
In a space frame, this is a static design choice; in a tetrobot, it is a
dynamic choice that can be used to twist the robot and/or exert linear or
angular force on the environment.

Ideally we would have a simple formula for defining the nodes based on
any curvature or pitch we choose. It is a goal of
this paper to relate these two approaches to generating a tetrahelix
continuum.


H.S.M Coxeter constructs the BC helix\cite{coxeter1985simplicial} as a repeated rotation and translation of the tetrahedra, showing the
rotation is:
\[
\theta_{bc} = \arccos(-2/3) 
\]
and the translation:
\[
h_{bc} = 1/\sqrt{10}
\]

$\theta_{bc}$ is approximately $0.37 \cdot 2 \pi$ radians or  $131.81$ degrees.
The angle $\theta_{bc}$ is the rotation of \emph{each} tetrahedron, not the tetraheda along a rail.  In \cref{fig:closeup},
each tetrahedron has either a yellow, blue, or red outer edge or rail.
That is, a blue-rail tetrahedron is rotated slightly more than a $1/3$ of a revolution to match the face of the yellow tetrahedra.

R.W. Gray's site\cite{graytetrahelix}, repeating a formula by Coxeter\cite{coxeter1985simplicial} in more accessible form, gives the Cartesian coordinates $\begin{bmatrix}
           x \\
           y \\
           z
         \end{bmatrix}$
for a counter-clockwise BC Helix:
\begin{equation}
  \label{graycoxeter}
V(n) =
\left [
  \begin{tabular}{c}
   $ r_{bc} \cos{n \theta_{bc}} $\\
   $ r_{bc} \sin{n \theta_{bc}} $\\
   $ n h_{bc}  $
  \end{tabular}
  \right ],
\text{where:}
  \begin{tabular}{c}
 $ r_{bc} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{10} \approx 0.5196 $\\
 $ h_{bc} = 1/\sqrt{10} \approx 0.3162 $ \\
 $ \theta_{bc} = \arccos(-2/3) $ \\
  \end{tabular}      
\end{equation}
where $n$ represents each integer numbered node in succession on every colored rail.

The apparent rotation of a vertex an outer-edge, $V(n)$ relative from $V(n+3)$ for any integer $n$
in \eqref{graycoxeter}, is $3 \theta_{bc} - 2\pi$).

This formula defines a helix, but it is not any of the apparent helices, or \emph{rail} helices, of the
BC helix, but rather one that winds three times as rapidly through all
nodes. To a designer of tetrahelices, it is more natural to think of
the three helices which are visually apparent, that is, those three
which are closely approximated by the outer edges or rails of
the BC helix. We think of each of these three rails as being a different color: red, blue, or yellow.
This situation is illustrated in \cref{fig:helixcomparison}, wherein the black helix represents that
generated by \cref{graycoxeter},
and the colored helices are generated by \cref{eq:colored}. 



In order to develop the continuum of slightly irregular tetrahelices described in \cref{sec:continuum},
we need a formula that gives us the nodes of just
one rail helix, denoted by color $c$ and integer node number $n$:
\[
(\forall n \in \mathbb{Z}, \forall c \in \{0,1,2\} : H_{BCcolored}(n,c) = V(3n +c))
\]

Such a helix can be written:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:colored}
H_{BCcolored}(n,c) =
\left [
  \begin{tabular}{c}
   $ r_{bc}  \cos{((3 \theta_{bc} - 2 \pi)n + c  \theta_{bc})}  $\\
   $ r_{bc} \sin{((3 \theta_{bc} - 2 \pi)n + c  \theta_{bc})} $\\
   $ 3 h_{bc} (n + c/3)  $
  \end{tabular}
  \right ],
\text{where}
  \begin{tabular}{c}
 $ r_{bc} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{10} $\\
 $ h_{bc} = 1/\sqrt{10} $ \\
 $ \theta_{bc} = \arccos(-2/3) $ \\
  \end{tabular}      
\end{equation}

In this formula, integral values of $n$ may be taken as a node number for one rail and used to compute its Cartesian
coordinates. Allowing $n$ to take non-integer values defines a continuous
helix in space which is close to the segmented polyline of the outer tetrahedra edges, and equals them at integer
values.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
     \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/Unified.png}
     \caption{Rail helices (H) vs. Coxeter/Gray helix (V) }
  \label{fig:helixcomparison}  
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:helixcomparison} illustrates this difference with a 7-tetrahedra BC helix, which is
in fact the same geometry as the robot illustrated in \cref{fig:glussbot}.
Although the nodes conincide,
\cref{graycoxeter} evaluated
at real values generates the black helix which runs through every node, and \cref{eq:colored} defines
the red, yellow, and blue helices. (In this figure
these rail helices have been rendered at a slightly higher radius than the nodes for clarity;
in actuality the maximum distance between the continuous, curved helix and the
straight edges between nodes is much smaller than can be clearly rendered.)

The quantity $ (3 \theta_{bc} - 2 \pi) \approx 35.43 \degree $  is the angular shift between $V(3n + c)=H_{BCcolored}(n,c)$ and
$V(3(n+1)+c)=H_{BCcolored}(n+1,c)$.
This quantity appears so often that we call it the ``rail angle $\rho$''. For the BC helix, $\rho_{bc} = (3 \theta_{bc} - 2 \pi)$.

\begin{figure}[H]
     \centering
     \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/RailAngleGeometry.png}
     \caption{Rail Angle Geometry}
  \label{railanglefig}
\end{figure}

Note in \cref{railanglefig} the $z$-axis travel for one rail edge is denoted by $d$. In \eqref{graycoxeter} and \eqref{eq:colored}, the variable
$h$ is used for one third of the distance we name $d$. We will later justify that $d = 3h$.
In this paper we assume the length of a rail
is always $1$ as a simplification, except in proofs concenring rail length.
(We make the rail length a parameter in our JavaScript code in
\url{https://github.com/PubInv/tetrahelix/blob/master/js/tetrahelix_math.js} \cite{readtetrahelix}.)

The $H_{BCcolored}(n,c)$ formulation can be further clarified by rewriting directly in terms of the rail angle $\rho_{bc}$ rather than $\theta_{bc}$.
Intuitively we seek an expression where $c/3$ is multiplied by a $1/3$ rotation plus the rail angle $\rho$.
We expand 
the expressions $\theta_{bc}$ and $\rho_{bc}$ in \eqref{eq:colored} and seek to isolate the term $c2\pi/3 $.
\begin{align*}
 c \theta_{bc}  &=   \text{\{we aim for 3 in denominator, so we split...\}} \\
    (c/3)  (3 \theta_{bc})  &=   \text{\{we want $2\pi$ in numerator, so add canceling terms...\}} \\
 (c/ 3) ((3 \theta_{bc} - 2 \pi)  + 2 \pi) &= \text{\{definition of $\rho_{bc}$\}...} \\  
  (c / 3) \rho_{bc}  + c 2 \pi /3 &=  \text{\{algebra...\}} \\  
c  ( \rho_{bc} +  2 \pi) /3  \\
\end{align*}

This allows us to redefine:

%% Actually, I am not sure if this is a clearer formulation...it might be, and need to put it in general!!!
\begin{equation}
H_{BCcolored}(n,c) =
\left [
  \begin{tabular}{c}
    $ r  \cos{\rho_{bc} n + c (\rho_{bc} +  2 \pi) /3} $\\
   $ r  \sin{\rho_{bc} n + c (\rho_{bc} +  2 \pi) /3} $\\
   $ (n+c/3)  h_{bc} $
  \end{tabular}
  \right ],
\text{where}
  \begin{tabular}{c}
%%  $\kappa = n + c/3$ \\
    $\rho_{bc} = (3 \theta_{bc} - 2 \pi)$ \\
    $ h_{bc} = 1/\sqrt{10} $ \\    
  \end{tabular}      
\end{equation}

Recall that $c \in \{0,1,2\}$, but $n$ is continuous (rational or real-valued.)
We can now assert that in \cref{fig:helixcomparison} the black helix winds at
$\frac{3 \theta_{bc}}{\rho_{bc}} \approx 11.16 $ times the rate of a rail helix.

From this formulation it is easy to see that moving one vertex on a rail
($H_{BCcolored}(n,c)$ to $H_{BCcolored}(n+1,c)$ for any $n$ and $c$)
moves us $\rho_{bc}$ radians around a circle. Since:
\[ \frac{2 \pi}{\rho_{bc}} \approx 10.16
\]
we can see that there are approximately $10.16$ red, blue or yellow tetrahedra on one rail in a single revolution.

The \emph{pitch} of any tetrahelix, defined as the axial length of a complete revolution
where $\rho \neq 0$ is:
\begin{equation}
  \label{pitcheqn}
p(\rho) = \frac{2 \pi  \cdot d}{\rho}
\end{equation}

The pitch of the Boerdijk--Coxeter helix of edge length $1$ is the length of three tetrahedra times this number:
\begin{align*}
   \frac{3 h_{bc}\cdot  2 \pi }{\rho_{bc}} 
  &= \frac{6 \pi}{\sqrt{10}\rho_{bc}} 
  &\approx 9.64 
\end{align*}


The pitch is less than the number of tetrahedra because the tetrahedra
are not lined up perfectly.  It is a famous and interesting result
that the pitch is irrational. A BC helix never has two tetrahedra at
precisely the same orientation around the $z$-axis. However, this is
inconvenient to designers, who might prefer a rational pitch.
The idea of developing a rational period by arranging solid tetrahedra by relaxing the face-to-face matching
has been explored\cite{sadler2013periodic}. 
We develop below slightly irregular edge lengths that support, for example, a pitch of precisely 12
tetrahedra in one revolution which would allow an architect to design a
column having a basis and a capital in the same relation to the
tetrahedra they touch at the bottom and top of the column.


\section{Optimal Tetrahelices are Triple Helices}

We use the term \emph{tetrahelix} to mean any structure made of
vertices and edges which is isomorphic to the BC helix and in which the
vertices lie on three helices. We further demand that all edge lengths
be finite, as we are only interested in physically constructable tetrahelices.
By isomporphic we mean there is a one-to-one mapping between both
vertices and edges in the two tetrahelices.
One could consider various definitions of optimality for a
tetrahelix, but the most useful to us as robotocists working with the Tetrobot
concept is to minimize the
maximum ratio between any two edge lengths, because the Tetrobot uses
mechanical linear acutators with
limited range of extension.

A \emph{triple helix} is three congruent helices that share an axis. We show that
optimal tetrahelices are in fact triple helices with the same radius, so that all
vertices are on a cylinder. In, stages, we demonstrate that optimal tetrahelices:
\begin{enumerate}
\item have the same pitch,
\item have parallel axes,
\item share the same axis,
\item have the same radius,
  \item have the same rail lengths,
  \item have axialy equidistant nodes, and therefore
  \item are in fact triple helices.
\end{enumerate}

Suppose that all three rails do not have the same pitch. Starting at any shortest edge between
two rails, as we move
from node to node away from our start edge the edge lengths
between rails must always lengthen without bound,
which cannot be optimal.
So we are justified in talking about the
\emph{pitch} of 
the optimal tetrahelix as the pitch of its three rail helices, even though there are
three such helices of equivalent pitch.

Similarly, if the axes are not parallel, there is an edge of
unbounded length in the structure, so we do not consider such cases.

Define a \emph{minimax edge-length optimal tetrahelix} or just an
\emph{optimal tetrahelix} to be a tetrahelix for which there exists
no other tetrahelix with lower ratio of longest edge length to shortest edge length.

We wish to show that in an optimal tetrahelix, all vertices lie on the cylinder
of radius $r$, regardless of where they lie on the $z$-axis.

%% Since all three rails have the same rail edge length, no matter how we
%% move the rails in the $xy$ plane if we shorten the $xy$ distance between
%% vertices we shorten the total distance.
%% Our tool for thinking about this is to collapse the $z$ dimension to form
%% a two-dimensional figure of nodes and non-rail edges (see \cref{fig:wobble}.)
%% Consider the projection along the $z$ axis of all vertices and non-rail edges into the $xy$ plane, which will be
%% a figure of dots and connecting segments in the $xy$ plane. The convex
%% hull for any one helix projection will be a circle (if its pitch is
%% irrational) or a polygon if rational, or a point if the helix has
%% zero curvature. Each of these figures by definition lies outside the
%% circle of inradius $r_{in}$ in the $xy$ plane.

As a little lemma for the proof below, observe that a tetrahelix of zero radius, where
all points lie on the same line,
is not as optimal as a tetrahelix of a small radius. The edges between rails will be
shorter than the rail edges, and moving them apart slightly lengthens the between-edge
rails.

\begin{theorem}
  Any optimal tetrahelix with a rail angle of magnitude less than $\pi$ has all three
  axes conincident.
  \label{thm:conincident}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Case 1: Suppose that $\rho$ is zero. Then for any given inradius, the
  figure in the $XY$-plane of an equilateral
  triangle is the minimax solution for all non-rail edges. Since all
  rail edges are of length 1, this is the minimax solution for the entire set. Since
  the vertices of an equilateral triangle lie on a circle, all points in three-space lie on
  a cylinder.

  Case 2: Suppose that $\rho$ is positive but less than $\pi$.
  In this case each rail helix has
  curavature. The projection of points in the $XY$ plane creates a figure
  guaranteed to have point on either side of any line through the axis of such
  a helix, because the figure is either an $n$-gon or a circle.
  We show that the three helices share a common axis.

  Without loss of generality define the Red helix to have its axis on the $z$-axis.
  Without loss of generatlity define the Blue helix to be a helix that
  has an edge connection to the Red helix that is either a maximum or a minimum.
  Let $B'$ be the blue helix translated in the $XY$-plane so that its axis is the $z$-axis and
  condicent with the red helix $R$. Let $D$ be the distance between the axis of the Blue helix
  $B$ and $B'$. We will show that if $D>0$ then $B$ ``wobbles'' in a way that cannot be optimal.
  Define a wobble vector by:
  \begin{equation*}
    W(n) = B(n) - B'(n)
  \end{equation*}
  where $B(n)$ is the cartesian vector
  $\begin{bmatrix}
    x \\
    y 
  \end{bmatrix}$
  for the projection of the $n$th blue vertex.
  Note that $|| R(n) - B'(n+k)||$ is a constant for any $k$, because $R$ and $B'$ have the
  same pitch and the same axis, even if they do not have the same radius
  (which we are currently proving.)

  \Cref{fig:wobble} demonstrates illustrates this situation. Like most diagrams, it is
  over specific, in that the two circles are drawn of the same radius but we do not
  depend upon that in this proof.  The diagram represents the projection along the
  $z$ axis of points into the $XY$-plane.

  \begin{figure}[H]
     \centering
     \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/WobbleDiagram.png}
     \caption{Wobble Vectors from Non-Coincident Axes}
  \label{fig:wobble}
\end{figure}
  
  Since $-\pi<\rho<\pi$, each rail helix rotates about its axis as a function of $n$ and
  defines at least 3 unique points when projected onto the $XY$-plane around its axis.
  If $2\pi/\rho$ is irrational, it defines a circle. If $2\pi/\rho$ is rational it defines
  an n-gon in the $XY$-plane, where $n$ is at least 3 (when $\rho = 2\pi/3$).
  The set of wobbles $\{W(n) | \text{for any n}\}$ thus contains at least three vectors,
  pointing in different directions.
  For any point not at the origin, at least one of these vectors moves closer to the
  point and at least one moves further away.

    The set of all lengths in the tetrahelix is a superset of:
    $L = \{|| R(n) - B(n)||\}$, which by our choice has at least one longest or shortest
    length.
    $L = \{|| R(n) - (B'(n) + W(n))||\}$ and so
    $L = \{|| (R(n) - B'(n)) - W(n)||\}$.
    But $R(n) - B'(n)$ is a constant, so the minimax value of $L$ is improved as $||W(n)||$
    decreases.  
    By our choice, this improves the minimax value of the total tetrahelix.
    
    This process can be carried out on both the Blue and Yellow helices
    (perhaps simultaneously) until $W(n)$ is
    zero for both, finding a tetrahelix of improved overall minimax value at each step.
    So a tetrahelix is optimal only when $W(n) = 0$, and therefore when $D=0$
    $B(n) = B'(n)$, all three axes are conincident.
\end{proof}

Now that we have show that axes are conincident and parallel and that the pitches
are the same for all helices, we can assert that any optimum tetrahelix can
be generated with an equation for helices:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:triple}
V_{triple}(n,c) =
\left [
  \begin{tabular}{c}
   $ r_c \cos(n \alpha +  c 2 \pi /3 + \phi_c)$\\
   $ r_c \sin(n \alpha +  c 2 \pi /3 + \phi_c) $\\
   $ \frac{d(n +c / 3)}{3}   $
  \end{tabular}
  \right ],
\text{where:}
\begin{tabular}{c}
  $c \in \{0,1,2\}$
  \end{tabular}      
\end{equation}
which would not be much more complicated if the axes where not coincident.
Note that we have not yet show that the relationships of the radius $r$ or
the phase $\phi$ for the three helies, so we denoted them with a $c$ subscript to show
they are dependent on the color.
In \cref{sec:parameterizing} we give a more specific version of this formula which
is optimal.

In principle in any three helices generated with $\cref{eq:triple}
has at most nine distinct edge length classes. Each edge that connects
two rails potentially has a longer length and shorter length we donote with
a $+$ or $-$. So the classes are $\{$ RR, BB, YY, RB_+, RB_-, BY_+, BY_-, RY_+, RY_- \}$.
If when projecting all vertices on the the $z$-axis, the interval
defined by the $z$ axis value of its endpoints contains no other vertices,
we call it a \emph{one-hop} edge, and if it does contain another vertex we
call it a \emph{two-hop} edge.
Then there are 
3 rail edges $\{$ RR, BB, YY\}$,
3 one-hop lengths $\{$ RB_-, BY_-, RY_- \}$ between each pair of 3 rails,
and 3 two-hop
lengths $\{$ RB_+, BY_+, RY_+, \}$ between each pair of 3 rails,
where the two-hop length is at least the one-hop length.
However, if we generate the three helices symmetrically with \cref{eq:triple},
many of these lengths will be the same.
In fact, it is possible that there
will be only two distinct such classes.

Now we show that an optimal tetrahelix has the same radii for all three helices.
To do this exhibit a symmetric tetrahelix (not yet shown to be optimal) which
happens to be a triple helix, that has
the property that all rail edges are equal to all one-hop edges and all two-hop
edges are equal. 
Observe that although we have not get given the formula for the
radii of such a triple helix, we observe there are some values for $r$ and $\alpha$, and $\phi$
for which all the three helices are symmetrically and evenly spaced. Furthermore,
we can choose these values such that the three rail edges are of length unity and
so that the one-hop lengths are also all of length unity, and the two-hop lengths
are slightly longer. We call such a tetrahelix a two-class tetrahelix. 

Now consider a tetrahelix in which the radius of one of the helices is different.
By the connections made in a tetrahelix, any increase to a radius increases both
a one-hop and two-hop distance, and any decrease likewise decreases two.
Since there exists a tetrahelix which has only two distinct classes of edge lengths,
(the smaller being one-hop = rail, the larger being the two-hop distance), the helix
with a larger radius increases a longest edge without increasing a shortest edges.
Likewise, a helix with a smaller radius decreases a one-hop edge without decreasing
a two-hop edge.  Therefore, a tetrahelix with different radii is not optimal as some two-class 
tetrahelix generated by \cref{eq:triple}, and so it not optimal. We have not yet
proved that a two-class tetrahelix is optimal, but it suffices to show that there
exist such a better tetrahelix to show that different radii imply a suboptimal
tetrahelix.

Because an optimal tetrhelix has equivalent radii and equivalent pitch for all three helices,
it has equivalent rail edge lengths. Likewise, there is a single rail angle $\rho$ that
represents the rotation of two nodes connected by a single rail edge, and it is the same
for all three rails.

%% \begin{theorem}
%%   \label{thm:cylinder}
%%   Any optimal tetrahelix with a rail angle less than $\pi$ has all vertices on a single cylinder.
%% \end{theorem}

%% \begin{proof}

%% Case 1: Suppose that $\rho$ is zero. Then for any given inradius, an equilateral
%% triangle is the minimax solution for all non-rail edges. Since there is only
%% one rail-edge length, this is the minimax solution for the entire set. Since

%%      \caption{Untouching Rail}
%%   \label{untouchingrailfig}
%% \end{figure}

%% \Cref{untouchingrailfig} depicts a projection of
%% only the point $P$, the point $P'$ which is an adjacent vertex on the same rail,
%% and the intermediary points $R$ and $Q$ on the other two rails.

%% Supoose there is a rail $P$ which does not have a segment touching the incircle
%% at all in the projection, as depicted in \cref{untouchingrailfig}.
%% Then a segment connecting the other two $Q$ and $R$ is a longest
%% rail, because any chord touching an incircle is longer than any which does not.
%% These two rails ($Q$ and $R$) can be moved closer to each other, and further away from $P$,
%% to form a better minimax solution
%% by shortening the longest rail, until one of the segments from $P$, the previously
%% untouching rail, touches the incircle. By induction, then all rails have
%% at least one segement touching each vertex on the rail that is tangent to the
%% incircle in an optimal tetrahelix.

%% Now suppose that you attempt to move the axis of one of the rails away from the center
%% for our circle. Because
%% $\rho > 0 $ and $\rho$ is not a multiple of $\pi$, there is some vertex on the two sides of any diameter
%% halving our circle. Moving the axis of a tetrahelix lengthens a longest line while ``pinching'' the
%% inradius on the other side, so it is not optimal. Since the axes of these helices are the
%% same and they have the same curvature and pitch, the points defined by the helices all lie
%% on a cylinder.
%% \end{proof}

%% Note: This is not a proof that they have the same radius, I will have to add that.

Now that we have shown that any optimal tetrahelix vertices
are on helices of the same axes and pitch, we see that the vertices 
of any optimal tetrahelix will lie on a cylinder, or a circle when axis dimension
is projected out. Therefore it is reasonable to now speak of the singular \emph{radius} $r$
of a tetrahelix as the radius of the cylinder.
We can now go on to
the harder proof about where vertices occur along the $z$-axis.

 We show that in fact the nodes must be distributed in even thirds
 along the $z$-axis, as in fact they are in the regular BC helix.

 Note that from the point of view of a single edge, we are on a
 slanted cylinder, when $\rho \neq 0$.  This means from its point of
 view a cross section is an ellipse. So we have to be very careful in
 comparing lengths of edges relative to the tetrahedron, because a
 change in position along the edge changes the length of a line, but
 in a complicated way depending on where it is relative to the
 ellipse.

 However, we have already shown the rail
 lengths are equal in any optimal tetrahelix.

\begin{figure}[H]
     \centering
     \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/EquitetrabeamCloseUp.png}
     \caption{Equitetrabeam}
  \label{fig:equitetrabeam}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:equitetrabeam} shows the equitetrabeam, which is defined in \cref{sec:equitetrabeam},
but also conveniently illustrates the one-hop and two-hop edge defintions.
The green edges are the two-hop edges and the purple edges are the one-hop edges. Note that the green
edges are slightly longer than the purple edges.


\begin{theorem}
  \label{eventhirds}
  An optimal tetrahelix of any rail angle $\rho < \pi$ is a triple helix with all vertices evenly spaced at $d/3$ intervals on the $z$ axis.
  Any one tetrahedron in a tetrahelix has $1$ rail edge, $2$ one-hop edges connected to the rail and $2$ two-hop edges connected to the rail.
  The edge opposite of the rail edge is a one-hop edge.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Consider the tetrahelix in which the vertices are evenly spaced at
    $d/3$ intervals on the $z$ axis. Every edge is either a rail edge,
    or it makes one hop, or it makes two hops. All of the one-hop
    edges are equal length.  All of the two-hop edges are equal
    length.

    Every vertex is connected to 4 non-rail edges. There is a one-hop edge
    in both the positive and negative $z$ direction. Likewise there is a two-hop
    edge in both the positive and negative $z$ direction. Let $A$ be the set
    of edge lengths, which has only 3 members, represented by $A = \{o,t,r\}$ for
    the one-hop, two-hop, and rail edge lengths.

    Any attempt to move any rail in either $z$ direction lengthens one two-hop edge to $t'$, where $t' > t$
    and shortens one one-hop edge $o' < o$. Let $B = \{o',t' \} \cup A$ be new edges.
    The minimax of $B$ is greater than the minimax of $A$ since there is a single rail length which cannot be both greater
    than $t'$ and $o'$ and less than $t'$ and $o'$.
    Therefore, any optimal tetrahelix has all one-hop edges between all rails equal to each other, and
    all two-hop edges equal to each other, and the $z$ distances between rails equal, and therefore
    $d/3$ from each other.

\end{proof}

 Note that based on \cref{eventhirds}, there are only 3 possible lengths in an optimal tethrahelix,
 and we are justified in classifying edge lengths as \emph{rail}, \emph{one-hop}, or
\emph{two-hop}. The one-hop edges are the edges between rails that are closest on the $z$-axis, and the two-hop edges are those that skip over a vertex.

In \cref{sec:parameterizing} have not yet investigated in the general case the relationships beteween
$\alpha$, $r$, $\phi$ and $d$ in \cref{eq:triple}.
However, we observe that when $\alpha = 0$, the helices are degenerate, having curvature of $0$, and
we have the equitetrabeam.

Taking all of these results together, 
each helix in an optimal tetrahelix is congruent to the others, shares an axis, is the same radius, and are evenly spaced
axially.
An optimal tetrahelix is therefore a \emph{triple helix}.

\section{Parameterizing Tetrahelices via Rail Angle}
\label{sec:parameterizing}

We seek a formula to generate optimal tetrahelices that accepts a
parameter that allows us to design the tetrahelix conveniently.
Please refer back to \cref{railanglefig}.
The pitch of the helix is an obvious choice, but is not defined when the
curvature is $0$, an important special case. The radius or the axial
distance between two nodes on the same rail are possible choices, but
perhaps the clearest choice is to build formulae that takes as their
input the ``rail angle'' $\rho$. We define $\rho$ to be the angle
formed in the X,Y plane $\angle H(0,0) O H(0,1)$ projecting out the $z$
axis and sighting along the positive $z$ axis. In other words, $\rho$
controls how far a rail edge of a tetrahelix deviates from being
parallel with the axis, or the ``twistiness'' of the tetrahelix. We use
the parameter $\chi = 1$ to indicate a chirality of counter-clockwise,
and $\chi = -1$ for clockwise.

The quantities $\rho,r,d$ are related by the expression:

\begin{align*}
  1^2 &= d^2 + (2 r \sin{ \rho / 2})^2 \\
%%  1 &= d^2 + 4 r^2 (\sin{ \rho / 2})^2 \\
  d^2 &= 1 - 4 r^2 (\sin{ \rho / 2})^2    \numberthis  \label{railangle} \\
\end{align*}

Checking the important special case of the BC helix, we find that this equation
indeed holds true (treating $d$ in this equation as $3 h_{bc}$ as defined by
Gray and Coxeter, that is, $d_{bc} = 3h_{bc}$, where they are using
$h$ for the axial height from one node to
the next of a different color, but we use $d$ to mean distance between nodes of
the  same color.

The rail angle $\rho$ also has the meaning that $2 \pi / \rho$ is the number of
tetraheda in a full revolution of the helix.

In choosing $\rho$, one greatly constrains $r$ and $d$, but does not completely
determine both of them together, so we treat both as parameters.

Rewriting our formulation in terms of $\rho$:
\begin{align*}
\numberthis  \label{eq:general}  
H_{general}(\chi,n,c,\rho,d_{\rho},r_{\rho}) &= 
 \left [
  \begin{tabular}{c}
   $ r_{\rho} \cos(\chi \cdot (n \rho + c(\rho +  2 \pi) /3)) $\\
   $ r_{\rho}  \sin(\chi \cdot (n \rho + c(\rho +  2 \pi) /3)) $\\
   $ d_{\rho} (n + c /3) $
  \end{tabular}
  \right ] \\
\text{where: } &
\begin{tabular}{c}
  $   1 = d_{\rho}^2 + 4 r_{\rho}^2 (\sin{ \rho / 2})^2 $ \\
    $\chi \in \{-1,1\}$ \\  
\end{tabular}
\end{align*} 


$H_{general}$ forces the user to select three values: $\rho$, $r_{\rho}$, and $d_{\rho}$ satisfying \eqref{railangle}.

Note that when $\rho = 0$ then $d_{\rho} = 1$, but $r_{\rho}$ is not determined by
\cref{railangle}.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{generalformulaoptimal}
  The tetrahelices generated by $H_{general}$ are optimal in terms of minimum maximum ratio of member length when $r_{\rho}$ is chosen so that
  the length of the one-hop edge is equal to the rail length.
\end{theorem}


\begin{proof}
This is proved by a minimax argument.

By \cref{eventhirds}, we can compute the (at most) three edge-lengths of an optimal
tetrahelix by formula universally quantified by $n$ and $c$:
\begin{align*}
  \text{rail} &= dist(H_{general}(n,c,\rho,d_{\rho},r_{\rho}),H_{general}(n+1,c,\rho,d_{\rho}),r_{\rho})) = 1 \\
  \text{one-hop} &= dist(H_{general}(n,c,\rho,d_{\rho},r_{\rho}),H_{general}(n,c+1,\rho,d_{\rho},r_{\rho}))  \\
  \text{two-hop} &= dist(H_{general}(n,c,\rho,d_{\rho},r_{\rho}),H_{general}(n,c+2,\rho,d_{\rho},r_{\rho}))  \\  
\end{align*}
where $dist$ is the Cartesian distance function.

\begin{align*}
  \text{one-hop} &= dist(H_{general}(n,c,\rho,d_{\rho}),H_{general}(n,c+1,\rho,d_{\rho}),r_{\rho})  \\
%%  \text{one-hop} &= dist(H_{general}(0,0,\rho,d_{\rho}),H_{general}(0,1,\rho,d_{\rho},r_{\rho}))  \\  
%%  \text{one-hop}  &= \sqrt{\frac{d_{\rho}^2}{9} + (r_{\rho}\sin(0) - r_{\rho}\sin(\rho/3+1\cdot\frac{2\pi}{3}))^2  +
%%    (r_{\rho}\cos(0) - r_{\rho}\cos(\rho/3 + 1\cdot\frac{2\pi}{3}))^2} \\
%%  \text{one-hop}  &= \sqrt{\frac{d_{\rho}^2}{9} + (0  - r_{\rho}\sin(\rho/3 + \frac{2\pi}{3}))^2  +
%%    (r_{\rho} - r_{\rho}\cos(\rho/3 + \frac{2\pi}{3}))^2} \\
%%  \text{one-hop}  &= \sqrt{\frac{d_{\rho}^2}{9} + r_{\rho}^2\sin^2(\rho/3 + \frac{2\pi}{3})  +
%%    r_{\rho}^2(1 - \cos(\rho/3 + \frac{2\pi}{3}))^2} \\
  %% Formula above checks at sqrt(8/27), 1, 0, and rho_bc, h_bc, r_bc.
  \text{one-hop}  &= \sqrt{\frac{d_{\rho}^2}{9} + r_{\rho}^2(\sin^2(\rho/3 + \frac{2\pi}{3})  + (1 - \cos(\rho/3 + \frac{2\pi}{3}))^2)} \\
  \text{but: }  d_{\rho}^2 &= 1 - 4 r_{\rho}^2 (\sin( \rho / 2)^2 \text{ ...so we substitute:}\\
  %% Formula above checks at sqrt(8/27), 1, 0, and rho_bc, h_bc, r_bc.  
  \text{one-hop}  &= \sqrt{\frac{1}{9}  + r_{\rho}^2(-\frac{4 (\sin^2( \rho / 2))}{9} + \sin^2(\rho/3+ \frac{2\pi}{3})  + (1 - \cos(\rho/3 + \frac{2\pi}{3}))^2)} \\
  %% Formula above checks at sqrt(8/27), 1, 0, and rho_bc, h_bc, r_bc.    
\end{align*}

By similar algebra and trigonometry:
\begin{align*}
  \text{two-hop}  &= \sqrt{\frac{4}{9} + r_{\rho}^2 (-\frac{16 (\sin^2( \rho / 2))}{9} + \sin^2(2\rho/3 + \frac{4\pi}{3})  + (1 - \cos(2\rho/3 + \frac{4\pi}{3}))^2)} \\
\end{align*}

We would really like to know the partial derivative of the two-hop - one-hop with respect
to the radius to be able to understand how to choose the radius to form the minimimax optimum.

Let:
\begin{equation*}
  f_{\rho} = -\frac{4 (\sin^2( \rho / 2))}{9}
  \end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
  g_{\rho} = -\frac{16 (\sin^2( \rho / 2))}{9} 
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
  j_{\rho} = \sin^2(\rho/3+ \frac{2\pi}{3})  + (1 - \cos(\rho/3 + \frac{2\pi}{3}))^2)
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
  k_{\rho} = (\sin^2(2\rho/3 + \frac{4\pi}{3})  + (1 - \cos(2\rho/3 + \frac{4\pi}{3}))^2)
\end{equation*}

Then:
\begin{align*}
  \text{two-hop} - \text{one-hop}  &= \sqrt{\frac{4}{9}  + r_{\rho}^2(g_{\rho}+ j_{\rho})}
  - \sqrt{\frac{1}{9} +r_{\rho}^2(f_{\rho}+k_{\rho}) }
\end{align*}



By graph inspection using Mathematica, we see the partial derivative of this with respect to
radius $r_{\rho}$ is always negative.
Since the partial derivative of $\text{two-hop} - \text{one-hop}$ with respect to the
radius $r_{\rho}$ is negative up until $\rho_{bc}$ where it is $0$, 
we opitmize the overall minimax distance by choosing the largest radius
up until one-hop $= 1$, the rail-edge length.

Therefore we decrease the minimax length
of the whole system as we increase the radius
up to the point that the shorter, one-hop distance is equal to the rail-length ($1$).
Therefore, to optimize the whole system so long as $\rho \leq \rho_{bc}$,
we equate one-hop to $1$ to find the optimum radius:


\begin{align*}
  1 &=  \sqrt{\frac{1}{9}  + r_{opt}^2(-\frac{4 (\sin^2( \rho / 2))}{9} + \sin^2(\rho/3+ \frac{2\pi}{3})  + (1 - \cos(\rho/3 + \frac{2\pi}{3}))^2)} \\
  r_{opt} &= \frac{2}{\sqrt{\frac{9}{2} \cdot ( \sqrt{3} sin(\rho/3) + \cos(\rho/3)) + \cos(\rho)+ 8 }} \numberthis  \label{eqrhoopt} \\
\end{align*}

We can now give a formula for $ d_{opt} $ computed from $\rho, r_{opt}$ via the rail angle equation \eqref{railangle}:

\begin{align*}
  d_{opt}^2 &= 1 - 4 (\frac{2}{\sqrt{\frac{9}{2} \cdot ( \sqrt{3} \sin(\rho/3) + \cos(\rho/3)) + \cos(\rho)+ 8 }})^2 (\sin{ \rho / 2})^2   \\
%%  d_{opt}^2 &= 1 - 4 \frac{4(\sin{ \rho / 2})^2}{\frac{9}{2} \cdot ( \sqrt{3} \sin(\rho/3) + \cos(\rho/3)) + \cos(\rho)+ 8 }    \\
  d_{opt}^2 &= 1 - \frac{16(\sin{ \rho / 2})^2}{9 ( \sqrt{3} \sin(\rho/3) + \cos(\rho/3)) + \cos(\rho)+ 8 }    \\
%%  d_{opt}^2 &= 1 - \frac{16 \sin^2(\rho / 2) }{ \cos(\rho) + 9( \sqrt{3} \sin(\rho/3) + \cos(\rho/3)) + 8 }   \\
    d_{opt} &= \sqrt{1 - \frac{16 \sin^2(\rho / 2) }{ \cos(\rho) + 9( \sqrt{3} \sin(\rho/3) + \cos(\rho/3)) + 8 }}    \numberthis  \label{dopt}  \\      
\end{align*}

Thus, by computing $r_{opt}$  and $d_{opt}$ as a function of $\rho$ from this equation, we can construct minimax optimal tetrahelix for an $0 \leq \rho \leq \rho_{bc}$.
\end{proof}

\section{The Inradius}

\begin{figure}[H]
     \centering
     \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/AxialView.png}
     \caption{Axial view of a BC-Helix}
  \label{axialview}     
\end{figure}

Since the axes are parallel, we may define the \emph{inradius}, represented by the letter $i$, of a
tetrahelix to be the radius of the largest
cylinder parallel to this axis that is surrounded by each tetrahelix and pentrated by no edge.


If we look down the axis of an optimal tetrahelix as shown in \cref{axialview}, it happens that only one of the one-hop edges
(rendered in purple in our software)
comes closest to the axis. In other words, they define the radius of the incircle of the
projection, or the radius of a cylinder that would just fit inside the tetrahelix.
A formula for the inradius of the tetrahelix is useful if you are designing it as a structure that bears something internally,
such as a firehose, a pipe, or
a ladder for a human. The inradius $r_{in}(\rho)$ of
an optimal tetrahelix is a remarkably simple function of the radius $r$ and the rail angle $\rho$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:inradius}
  r_{in}(\rho) = r \sin{\frac{\pi - \rho}{6}}
\end{equation}
Which can be seen from the trigonometry of a diagram of the projected one-hop edges
connecting four sequentially numbered vertices:

\begin{figure}[H]
     \centering
     \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/ProjectionDiagram.png}
     \caption{General One-hop Projection Diagram}
  \label{projectiondiagram}
     
\end{figure}

From this equation with the help of symbolic computation we observe that inradius of the BC helix of unit rail length is $r_{in(\rho_{bc})} = \frac{3}{10\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.21$.

\section{The Equitetrabeam}
\label{sec:equitetrabeam}

Just as $H_{general}$ constructs the BC helix (with careful and non-obvious choices of parameters)
which is an important
special case due to its regularity, it constructs an additional special
(degenerate) case when the rail angle $\rho = 0$
and $d = 1$ (the edgelength), where the cross sectional area is
an equilateral triangle of unchanging orientation, as shown in \cref{fig:equitetrabeam} and at the rear of \cref{fig:series}.
We call this the \emph{equitetrabeam}. It is not possible to generate an equitetrabeam from \cref{graycoxeter}
without the split into three rails introduced by \cref{eq:colored} and completed in \cref{eq:general}.



\begin{corollary}
  The equitetrabeam with minimal maximal edge ratio is produced
  \newline by $H_{general}$ when $ r = \sqrt{\frac{8}{27}} $.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Choosing $d = 1$ and $\rho = 0$ we use Equation \eqref{eqrhoopt} to find the radius of 
optimal minimax difference.

Substituting into \eqref{eq:general}:

\begin{align*}
  \text{one-hop} &= \sqrt{\frac{1}{9} + 3r^2}\\
\end{align*}
Then:
\begin{align*}
   1  &=  \sqrt{\frac{1}{9} + 3r^2} & \text{ solved by... }\\
   r  &= \sqrt{\frac{8}{27}} &\approx 0.54 \\
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

This radius\footnote{Another interesting but non-optimal solution is derived by setting
  (one-hop + two-hop)/2 = 1,
  occurs at $r = \sqrt{35}/4$ which produces
  three length classes of $11/12, 12/12, 13/12$.}
produces a two-hop rail length of $\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$.
The difference between this and $1$ is $\approx 15.47\% $. The inradius of the equitetrabeam of unit
rail length from both Equation \eqref{eq:inradius} and the fact that the inradius of
an equilateral triangle is half the circumradius is $\sqrt{\frac{8}{27}}/2$, or $\frac{\sqrt{6}}{9}$.


In \cref{fig:series}, the furthest tetrahelix is the optimal equitetrabeam.
\Cref{fig:equitetrabeam} is a closeup of an equitetrabeam.

To the extent that we value tetrabeams (that is, tetrahelices with a rail angle of $0$,
and therefore zero curvature and curvature) as mathematical or engineering objects,
we have motivated the development of $H_{general}$ as a transformation of $V(n)$ defined by
Equation \eqref{graycoxeter} from Gray and Coxeter. It is difficult to see how
the $V(n)$ 
formulation could ever give rise to a continuum producing the tetrabeam,
since setting the angle in that equation to zero can produce only collinear points.

The equitetrabeam may possibly be a novel construction.
The fact that 6 members meet in a single point would have been a manufacturing disadvantage that
may have dissuaded structural engineers from using this geometry.
However, the advent of additive manufacturing, such a 3D printing, and the invention of two
distinct concentric multimember joints\cite{song2003spherical,HamlinSandersonCMS} has improved that situation.

Note that the equitetrabeam has chirality, which becomes important in our attempt to build a
continuum of tetrahelices.

\section{An Untwisted Continuum}
\label{sec:continuum}


We observe that Equations \eqref{eqrhoopt} and \eqref{dopt} compute $r_{opt}$ and $d_{opt}$ which
create an optimal tetrahelix for any rail angle $\rho$ between $0$, which
gives the equitetrabeam and
$\rho_{bc} \approx 35.43 \degree$, which gives the BC helix.

 Because the equitetrabeam which has a rail angle of $0$ still has
 chirality, that is, one still must decide to connect the one-hop edge to
 the clockwise or the counter-clockwise node, it is not possible to build
 a smooth continuum where $\rho$ transitions from positive to negative
 which remains optimal. One can use a negative $\rho$ in $H_{general}$
 but it does not produce minimax optimal tetrahelices. In other words,
 untwisting a counter-clockwise tetrahelix to rail angle $0$ and then going
even further does produce a clockwise tetrahelix, but one in which the
 one-hop and two-hop lengths in the wrong places (that is, two-hop
 becomes shorter than one-hop.) Likewise, $\rho > \rho_{bc}$ generates
 a tetrahelix, but minimax optimality is not guaranteed by $H_{general}$.
 
 The pitch of a helix (see \cref{pitcheqn}, for a fixed $z$-axis travel $d$,
 is trivial.
However, if one is computing 
$z$-axis travel from \eqref{dopt} the pitch is not simple.
It increases monotonically and smoothly with decreasing $\rho$, so
Equation \eqref{pitcheqn} can be easily solved numerically with a Newton-Raphson
solver, as we do on our website.
For a pitch at least $ p \geq \frac{3  \sqrt{2}  \pi}{\sqrt{5}\rho_{bc}} \approx 9.64 $,
using \eqref{dopt} produces minimax optimal tetrahelices.

In this way a rail angle can be chosen for any desired (sufficiently large) pitch, yield
the optimum radius, one-hop, and two-hop lengths an engineer needs to
construct a physical structure.

The curvature of a rail helix is foramlly given by:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{|r_{\rho}|}{r_{\rho}^2 + (d_{\rho}/\rho)^2}
\end{equation}
which goes to $0$ as $\rho$ approaches $0$ (the equitetrabeam.)
As $\rho$ increase up to $\rho_{bc}$ the curvature increases smoothly until the BC Helix is reached.

Perhaps surprisingly, the optimal untwisting is accomplished only by
changing the length of the two-hop member, leaving the one-hop member
and rail length equivalent within this continuum.\footnote{Before deriving Equation \eqref{eqrhoopt}, we created a continuum by
using a linear interpolation between the optimal radius for the
Equitetrabeam and the BC Helix. This minimax optimum of this simpler
approach was at most 1\% worse than the optimum computed by
\eqref{eqrhoopt}.}
 However, it should
be noted that an engineer or architect may also use $H_{general}$
directly and interactively, and that minimax length optimality is a
mathematical starting point rather than the final word on the beauty and utility of
physical structures. For example, a structural engineer might increase
radius past optimality in order to resist buckling.
%% Add a figure here of a deep beam and of an arch.

If an equitetrabeam were actually
used as a beam, an engineer might start with the optimal tetrabeam and
dilate it in one dimension to ``deepen'' the beam. Similarly, simple
length changes curve the equitetrabeam into an ``arch''.
The ``colored'' approach of \cref{eq:general} exposes these possibilities
more than the approach of \cref{graycoxeter}.

Trusses and space frames remain an important design field in
mechanical and structural engineering\cite{mikulas1985sequentially},
including deployable and moving trusses\cite{claypool2012readily}.


\section{Utility for Robotics}

Starting twenty years ago, Sanderson\cite{sanderson1996modular},
Hamlin,\cite{TetrobotBook}, Lee\cite{lee2002dynamic}, and others
 created a style of robotics based on changing
the lengths of members joined at the center of a joint, thereby
creating a connection to pure geometry. More recently NASA has
experimented with tensegrities\cite{NTRT}, a different point in the
same design spectrum. These fields create a need to explore the notion
of geometries changing over time, not generally considered directly by
pure geometry.

As suggested by Buckminster Fuller, the most convenient geometries to
consider are those that have regular member lengths, in order to
facilitate the inexpensive manufacture and construction of the robot.
In a plane, the octet truss\cite{richard1961synergetic} is such a geometry, but in a line, the
Boerdijk--Coxeter helix is a regular structure.

However, a robot must move, and so it is interesting to consider the
transmutations of these geometries, which was in fact the motivation
for creating the equitetrabream.

\begin{theorem}
  By changing only the length of the longer members that connect two distinct rails (the two-hop members), we can dynamically untwist a tetrobot
  forming the Boerdijk-Coxeter configuration into the equitetrabeam which rests flat on the plane.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Proof by our computer program that does this using Equation \eqref{eq:general} applied to the
  7-tet Tetrobot/Glussbot.

\begin{figure}[H] %float with two figures
  \centering
     \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/GlussBotBC.jpg}
     \caption{Glussbot in relaxed, or BC helix configuration}

     \caption{The Equitetrabream: Fully Untwisted Glussbot in Hexapod Configuration}
     \label{fig:glussbot}
\end{figure}

By untwisting the tetrahelix so that is has a planar surface resting on the ground,
we may consider each vertex touching the ground a foot or pseudopod. A robot can thus
become a hexapod or $n$-pod robot, and the already well-developed approaches to
hexapod gaits may be applied to make the robot walk or crawl.

\end{proof}

\section{Conclusion}

The BC Helix is the end point of a continuum of tetrahelices, the
other end point being an untwisted tetrahelix with equilateral cross
section, constructed by changing the length of only those members
crossing the outside rails after hopping over the nearest
vertex. Under the condition of miminum maximum length ratios of
all members in the system, all such tetrahelices have vertices evenly
spaced along the axis generated by a simple equation and are in fact triple helices.
A machine, such as a robot or a variable-geometry truss, that can change
the length of its members can thus twist and untwist itself by
changing the length of the appropriate members to achieve any point in
the continuum. With a numeric solution, a design may choose
a rotation angle and member lengths to obtain a desired pitch.

Reread everything, especially the new parts.



Proof Ideas:

Now that we have shown parallel and conincident, we can definie ``one-hop'' and ``two-hop''
clearly.

Can we show that one-hop < two-hop in an optimal tetrahelix?

This is true by definition, but we potentially have 6 such differences.
If all are less than the maximum rail edge, we are not optimal, as a lower rail edge
is better.
If all are > than the minimum rail edge, we are not opitimal, as we can raise that
rail edge.

So MAX(non-rail) >= MIN(rail-edge).
also: MIN(non-rail) <= MAX(rail).

Conjecture: Increasing Radius increases length of all attached nodes.
Lemma: If a line is drawn between a point P on one circule and a point Q on a nother circle,
and the circles are parallel in space,
increasing the radius of eitehr circle increases the length, no matter where the circles are,
and no matter where the points are on the circle.

Therefore if there is a single maximum radius and it has a longest edge coming to it,
the minimax is made better by decreasing that radius until equal with the next radius.

If a single radius is a shortest radius, the minimax is made better by
increasing it.

Can we proe this rigourously?

Does a single large radius necessarily have a longest edge?
A Rail edge would be longest if we allow any rotation, but we can severely
limit rail angle to \rho_{bc}.

New Idea:

Suppose Red is a largest radius.  Blue and Yellow must be symmetrically distributed
ccw and cw from Red.

Proof sketch: if Red is a largest radius, the two-hop edges to Yellow and Blue
are the longest two in the system.  Is one is longer than that other, rotating it
is more optimum.

Proof Idea:

If two-hop edges are always longest and one-hop always shortest, then they
should be equalized.


* * *

Proof idea.

Thm: An optimal tetrahelix has a longest edge which is a two-hop edge.

Proof:

Case 1: If the longest edge is a rail edge, construct a better minimax optimal
tetrahelix by increasing the radius of every helix, which does not change the
rail length, until a non-rail edge is equal to the rail edge.  This increases
the length of every non-rail edge, therefore it is a better helix.

Case 2: The longest edge is a non-rail edge.

WOLOG, this is an edge from Red to Blue. By assumption, at least one
of three things must be true:
1) The RED-BLUE 2-hop axial distance is longer than the other two 2-hop axial distances.
2) One rail (call it Red) has a larger radius.
3) The Red-Blue rails can be rotated closer together to decrease the
RED-BLUE distance. (If the angle between RED and BLUE is zero, then one
of the other must be true.)

In case 1), construct a better tetrahelix axially shifting the BLUE rails to decrease
the RED-BLUE 2-hop axial distance (and increase the 2-hop axial distance.) The effects
our classes by:
RR not affected
BB not affected
YY not affected
RB- increased
RB+ decreased
BY- decreased
BY+ increased
RY- not affected
RY+ not affected

So if the set of shortest edges does not include BY-, this tetrahelix is better.
If it does include BY-, we must show that RB+/BY- decreases as we move the rail.
We could show the actual derivative of this.  Informally, the angle is more direct,
so the change in RB+ should be greater. This may require comparison to the cylindrical
solution.  If we assume this is true for the cylindrical solution, then we have shown
a better solution exists. So case one is not optimal.

So we must show that if a shortest edge is in RY-, RY+, RB-, we have to
RB+ of these edges decreases. RY+ cannot be a shortest edge.
Idea: if RY-, RB- are shortest, increase Y, B radius.
So what does the derivative of RB+/RY- and RB+/RB- tell us? The further away it is,
the straighter the push, so it is likely that the RB+ edge changes faster than the RY- edge
decreases. If R has a bigger radius, can RY- be smaller than BY-? Seems like we will
have to use the algebraic formula to do this---but I have no proof yet that it is an triple helix.

Note, that if we could prove just this case, our equidistance proof would complete everything we need!
So I need to show that RB+/RY- decreases as we shrink the radius---in other words, the RB+ line
is more central than the RY- line.

In case 3), if we rotate blue towards red:

RR not affected
BB not affected
YY not affected
RB- decreases
RB+ decreases
BY- increases
BY+ increases
RY- not affected
RY+ not affected


Attempt to create Proof of Equal Radius:

Suppose that Red Radius is largest.

Case RB+ is longest:
We can understand the change of decreasing the Red Radius:

RR decreases
BB not affected
YY not affected
RB- decreases
RB+ decreases
BY- not affected
BY+ not affected
RY- decreases
RY+ decreases

Sub Case split:
Case RB- is smallest:
Increase B radius.
Case RY- is smallest:
Increase Y radius.
Case RR is smallest:
This is not possible if Red is has the largest Readius!
Case: RB- = RY-  are smallest.  In increase both B and Y.

Done case RB+ is longest.

Case YB+ is longest:

This can occur only if YB is not even 1/3rds.

Case:
YB- is the worst. Then we need to move the bar.

Case:
Rail BB is smallest.  Then  we are making better.

Case:
RB- is smallest (need to move blue.)
RY- is smallest (need to move yellow.)

(I think this is a combined proof.)

Case RB+ amd YB+ are both longest.

RR decreases
BB not affected
YY not affected
RB- decreases
RB+ decreases
BY- not affected
BY+ not affected
RY- decreases
RY+ decreases

Decrease R and simultaneously rotate Y towards B
to decrease YB+.

Done with case YB+ is longest.

Case RR is longest:

Decrease radius improves.

Now suppose the Red and Blue Radiii are equual and larger than yellow.

Case split RB+ is longest.

Increase Y does:
RR not affected
BB not affected
YY increases
RB- not affected
RB+ not affected
BY- increases
BY+ increases
RY- increases
RY+ increases

Sub case split: Shortest not RR,BB, or RB- or RB+, then we improve.
If it is a rail, decrease all radii until this is not true.

RB-, then we need to move Red relative to Blue. If we are already
at even thirds and proper rotation is this possible? This might require
going down the algebra level to prove.


Case split YB+ or YR+ is longest.

New Proof Idea:

Prove optimality of equal one-hop edges from simple diagram.
From that, show optimality of equidistance and radius.



New Proof Idea:

Proof that all radii are the same.

Lemma: There is a solution with all one-hop edges equal to all rail edges
and all two-hop edges longer.

Assume that the solution with all one-hop and rail distances the same
is optimal.  Assume that all two-hop edges are the same.

Any change to a radii either increases both or decreases both for
one set, thereby harming the optimum.  Y cannot be rotated
toward both Red and Blue. Y cannot be shifted toward both Red and Blue.
(We need a lemma here that Red and Blue are on the opposite side or the
line through the circle of Red.)
Therefore any different radius has a longer two-hop edge, and is not optimal.

If we have all radii the same, then our existing proof works for
equidistance.
